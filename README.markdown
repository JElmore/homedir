# home directory

Files from my home directory (work, laptop and shared hosting). Forked from
[Carlo](http://github.com/carlo/homedir/tree) who forked it from
[Brad](http://github.com/bradleywright/homedir/tree) who forked it from
[Norm](http://github.com/norm/homedir/tree).
Wow, this is getting confusing.


## The Idea

One homedir git repo for all my machines. Depending on OS and machine, different
files are used and executed.
